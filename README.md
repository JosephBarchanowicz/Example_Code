## Languages Included

- **Python** â€“ scripting, algorithms, automation, and practice problems  
- **Java** â€“ object-oriented programming, data structures, and design patterns  
- **C / C++** â€“ systems programming, embedded concepts, and performance-critical examples  
- **MATLAB** â€“ numerical computing, simulations, and signal/data processing  
- **VHDL** â€“ hardware description language examples for digital design and FPGA work  
- **Verilog** â€“ RTL coding, testbenches, and FPGA/ASIC design practice  

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to provide:
- Simple, self-contained examples to demonstrate language features  
- Problem-solving patterns across different languages  
- Reference material for interviews, coursework, or project bootstrapping  
- A collection of hardware-related HDL snippets for digital logic design  

---



Each folder contains code samples, exercises, or small projects specific to that language.

---

## How to Use

1. Browse to the language directory youâ€™re interested in.  
2. Open and run the examples in your preferred IDE or toolchain.  
   - Python: run with `python3 file.py`  
   - Java: compile with `javac File.java` then run `java File`  
   - C/C++: compile with `gcc file.c -o file` or `g++ file.cpp -o file`  
   - MATLAB: open `.m` files directly in MATLAB or Octave  
   - VHDL/Verilog: simulate using ModelSim, Vivado, or another HDL tool
